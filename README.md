BookingJini: AI-Powered Social Media Post Generator for Small Hotels

Background

In today's digital world, social media plays a crucial role in marketing, especially for
small hotels looking to engage with their audience. However, many hoteliers struggle
with designing creative graphics and writing engaging captions for special occasions
like Independence Day, Holi, Diwali, Women’s Day, and other events. The
process can be time-consuming and requires design and marketing expertise.

Challenge

Develop an AI-powered tool that enables small hotels to effortlessly create highquality, visually appealing social media posts based on their input. The tool should:

 Generate custom graphics and a short, engaging text paragraph based on
the occasion provided by the hotelier.
 Allow users to customize the generated post (edit text, adjust colors, change
layout, add hotel logo, etc.).
 Support direct integration with social media platforms like Instagram,
Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn for seamless posting.

Key Features to Consider

• AI-Generated Content: Automatically create creative and engaging posts
with unique graphics and text.
• Customization Options: Allow hoteliers to tweak the design and text before
publishing.
• Social Media Integration: Enable direct posting from the platform to various
social channels.
• User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for non-tech-savvy users.
Expected Outcome
A fully functional prototype or MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that empowers small
hotels to create and publish professional-looking social media posts quickly and
efficiently, boosting their online presence with minimal effort.
